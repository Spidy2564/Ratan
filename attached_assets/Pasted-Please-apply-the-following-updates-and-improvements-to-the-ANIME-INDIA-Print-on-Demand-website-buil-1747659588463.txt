Please apply the following updates and improvements to the ANIME INDIA Print on Demand website (built using React):

🔧 1. Fix: T-Shirt Mockup Not Working
On the Customization page, the T-shirt 3D mockup preview is not rendering or interactive.

Ensure the 3D viewer:

Loads correctly

Accepts uploaded designs for Front, Back, Sleeves, Neck

Supports 360° rotation

Displays uploaded image on the corresponding position in real-time

🔤 2. Fix: ANIME INDIA Logo Spacing
Currently “ANIMEINDIA” appears as a single word.

It should be clearly styled as two separate words:

ANIME (in Blood Red)

INDIA (in Black)

Add space or padding between the two words in the logo component.

🌫️ 3. Top Navigation Bar (Styling Upgrade)
Make the top Navbar translucent.

As users scroll through the page, the navbar background color should dynamically reflect the color theme of the current section.

For example: If the section is dark-themed, navbar should subtly darken; if it's light-themed, it should lighten while staying translucent.

Ensure this transition is smooth and does not obstruct readability.

🧩 4. Product Category Boxes (Visual Enhancement)
Apply a slightly translucent background effect (e.g., rgba(255,255,255,0.85) or similar) to:

All product category boxes (e.g., Regular T-Shirts card, Phone Covers, etc.)

The description area within these cards/boxes should also inherit the translucency.

Ensure the text inside remains clearly legible.

🧠 5. "Why Choose ANIME INDIA" Section
The highlight boxes (each with a pointer like “Premium Quality”, “Fast Shipping”, etc.) should:

Have translucent backgrounds (same style as product cards)

Retain sharp contrast between icons and background

📬 6. Contact Us Form Box
The form box for raising concerns or tickets should also:

Have a light translucent effect

Maintain visual consistency with other section cards

Border and input fields should stay crisp and easy to interact with

🦶 7. Footer Aesthetic Upgrade
Make the footer more visually appealing while keeping it minimal and brand-aligned.

Suggestions:

Add clean horizontal dividers

Include a stylized version of the ANIME INDIA logo

Slight gradient or darkened translucent background

Animated social icons or hover effects

Make sure it’s responsive and matches the site's overall anime-inspired aesthetic
